                            <p>Arkham was a scholar, father of Lady, and the main antagonist of Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening.</p>                            
                        </div>
                        <div class="fifth-box">
                           <p>Despite the failed ritual, Arkham is undeterred in his mission. As told by Lady, Arkham would go on to kill innocent people in his drive for demonic power, but likely also ended in failure. At some point in time, Arkham also comes to know the history of the Temen-ni-gru, an unholy tower constructed by devil worshipers in order to break down the veil between the Human World and the Demon World. Eventually, Arkham comes in contact with Vergil, the elder of the twin sons of Sparda, in a library. Being completely aware of Vergil's demonic heritage and desire to gain demonic power like himself, Arkham explains to Vergil that resurrecting the tower is the way to obtain his father's ultimate power. He then decides to work with Vergil in order to help him acquire the power of Sparda. However, little does Vergil know is that he is only a pawn in Arkham's own scheme to gain Sparda's power.</p>
                           <p>Arkham and Vergil then rendezvous at the lower entrance of the Temen-ni-gru. As Vergil unseals and renames the majority of the Seven Sins of the tower, Arkham goes over to the younger of twin sons of Sparda, Dante. Arkham reveals himself to Dante, taking note of his half of the Perfect Amulet around Dante's neck, and tells him that his brother has sent him an invitation. He disappears after flipping over Dante's desk, leaving him to battle a small group 7 Hells; consisting of Hell Prides, Hell Lusts, Hell Sloths, and a Hell Vanguard.</p>
                           <p>After the Temen-ni-gru rises from the from beneath the earth, Arkham stands at its peak with Vergil, reveling in its mystique and informing Vergil that Dante indeed still has his half of the Perfect Amulet.</p>
                           <p>Arkham then becomes aware that his daughter, Mary, is lurking within the tower, and goes to the lower levels to confront her. On his way down, he runs into Dante and assumes the form of Jester. Dante having advanced to the upper levels after defeating the first guardian Cerberus. As Jester, Arkham annoyingly aids Dante in moving up the tower. He then encounters Mary, tries to provoke her into shooting him, taunts her about the fact that he was the one who named her, and then tossed her over the tower's edge. He would later meet with Vergil again, who has succeeded in besting Dante in battle and taking his half of the Perfect Amulet.</p>
                           <p>And then, he and Vergil escaped to the lower sanctums of the tower to put the next phase of their plan into motion.</p>
                           <p>At the lower sanctums, Arkham continues to speak in awe about how the Temen-ni-gru has inspired fear into the hearts of men and how the evils within it were sealed by Sparda. Arkham and Vergil then make their way to the Obsidian Path. There, Vergil becomes suspicious of Arkham because he let Mary live. Although Arkham did give Vergil a reasonable answer, Vergil was not convinced and proceeded to stab Arkham in the back. Vergil then chastised Arkham on his failure to gain demonic power; in response, Arkham pointed out Vergil's own incomplete nature as a half-demon. Finally, Vergil stabbed Arkham again and mortally wounded him. Vergil left Arkham for dead and proceeded without him.</p>

                    <p>Arkham appears as a tall, pale-skinned bald male adult. He dresses in a rather simple minister-esque fashion consistently of a purely black-colored ensemble devoid of color or any lightly-colored shades. His most distinguishing feature aside from his heterochromia is a large burnt scar covering the entire left side of his head and barely creeping over his face.</p>
